# Project is build using java under Netbeans IDE using LINUX OS

The online examination project encompasses a range of essential functionalities to ensure a seamless and efficient assessment experience. 
It begins with a secure and user-friendly login system, providing authorized access to the examination platform. Participants have the capability 
to manage their profiles and passwords, facilitating personalization and security. The project further facilitates the process of answering multiple-choice questions 
(MCQs) by allowing examinees to make selections based on their knowledge. To maintain fairness and adherence to time constraints, a timer feature has been integrated, 
ensuring that participants complete the exam within the stipulated duration; in cases of exceeding time limits, an auto-submit function activates. Upon completion or 
when desired, users have the ability to appropriately close their examination session and subsequently log out, concluding their engagement with the platform. 
These functionalities collectively create an effective and comprehensive online examination environment.
